# alpaca-trading-algo
A library of Alpaca trading scripts

Insert your API Keys from Alpaca. 

You can use a paper trading account or a live trading account. 

You may have to regenerate a secret key each time you close the alpaca site and place it into the api key section. 

Running the main.py file will submit the order. 

It works best to have the alpaca dashboard open when submitting the order so that you can verify the trade in real-time.
